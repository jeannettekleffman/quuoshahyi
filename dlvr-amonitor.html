                            <p>I used to write CL daily but sadly haven't touched it in quite some time. I also don't believe I ever used macros so extensively (beyond with-x style macros). I also recall that extensive abuse of anaphoric macros is a bad idea. However, I'm trying to inject some more CL into my daily routine, and had a particular case where I want to make use of anaphora. I have a CL instance running that I use to notify me of some things, run some jobs manually and/or automatically. I'd like to write these. Previously: There Will Be Stupidity (https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/72ug4g/there_will_be_stupidity/) I found myself sitting amongst a veritable sea of blank faces in a chair that was surely engineered by an individual with a severe spinal deformity. I turned my gaze every which way about my office’s conference hall, pausing for a moment to study each unblinking, emotionless visage. Were they even alive? I thought. Was I alive? Did it finally happen?. Hello IAmA Readers, After evaluating some of the effects of recent algorithm changes, the IAmA Moderator Team will be changing our rules about AMA requests starting immediately. AMA requests should now be posted to /r/IAmARequests. We also encourage you to tweet your requests and include @reddit_AMA, so we can help boost the signal. Why the change? Well, it comes down to three main reasons: 1. Algorithm changes over the past year  AMA Requests were introduced long before the introduction. From what I can tell, a used vega 56 is only about 50-100 AUD more than a used 1070ti, but they perform at the same level (and with OC and BIOS mods the 56 is significantly better), and the freesync capabilites of the 56 would remove any price advantage the 1070ti has, if you are buying amonitor as well. What do you all think would be better, taking into account gaming and productivity. I would really appreciate suggestions on a desktop. I play World of Warcraft and a vast amount of mp3s. I will not attempt to build one so I am looking for a prebuilt , oh and amonitor, mouse and keyboard are not needed. This is one I have found https://www.bestbuy.com/site/cyberpowerpc-gamer-master-desktop-amd-ryzen-7-16gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-gtx-1080-120gb-ssd-2tb-hard-drive-gray/5785617.p?skuId=5785617 (https://www.bestbuy.com/site/cyberpowerpc-gamer-master-desktop-amd-ryzen-7-16gb-memo. Previously: The Purge (https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/6prbae/the_purge/) The ticking of the clock above me was interminable. Its gears churned ever forward, producing the familiar clicks that slowly ate away at the base of my skull in a seemingly infinite crescendo. I found myself wondering if the previous occupant of my cubicle had shared my fantasies of its destruction, for it was steadfastly affixed to the wall with an exceptional epoxy. My desk phone 
I'm lost. I've been loking into building a new pc since like last summer, but the prices are just too high right now. I'm really kinda split up ewtwen what i want, one day i want a pc that will run on a 1080p 240hz monitor, next day 1440p 144hz monitor, next day i want an ultrawide. the problem is, i love playing rpg games, but i also love playing league of legends and fortnite with my boys. first of all, can some1 help to decide me on amonitor? 2nd of all, all my knowledle about pcs is theore. Prologue I'm a SQL Developer at a large BPO company, the details of which I shall spare. This story takes place in the winter of 2015. I sat at my corner desk contemplating my own existence as I waited for some ad-hoc code to run. The cold emanated from the window beside me where moments earlier I had witnessed a goose tumble down a snow covered hill into a pile of its own excrement. The Cold Diversion My trance was abruptly shattered by the resident gossip, Twitchy Anne who annou. Hello, my monitor went all purple ( https://i.imgur.com/ftzg6Iz.jpg ). Sometimes goes back to normal and other times stays like this for a loooong time. I tried a new VGA cable and it didnt work, it actually got a little bit worst at first staying all fuzzy and purple. If i dulpicate the image or use the tv as amonitor looks fine. The monitor is an LG Flatron E2350 that must have like 9 or 10 years by now. Thanks in advance.
